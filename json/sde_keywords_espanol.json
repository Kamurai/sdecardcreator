This will vary depending on the<br>type of area effect being used.<br>• Burst X requires that you select a single model, in line of sight<br>to the model using the effect, as the action’s target. The area<br>effect is centered on that target.<br>• Cross X, Wave X, and Aura X are centered on the user. In this<br>case the user is considered the target but it is not affected by<br>its own area effect unless the effect states otherwise (such as<br>in the case of AUGMENT).<br>•Lance X, Spray X, and Sweep X require that you choose one<br>square that is adjacent (but not diagonal) to the model using<br>the effect. Then determine the remaining squares affected<br>from the initial square chosen, using the area effect’s rules<br>and diagrams as a guide. Unlike other effects the initial square<br>chosen may be empty.<br>• If the area effect is part of an attack, make a single attack roll<br>and apply it to every model affected. Each model affected<br>makes their own defense roll, comparing their result to the<br>attack roll separately.<br>• All models affects by an area effect are considered to be hit<br>simultaneously.<br>• Friendly models, including the user, are not affected by area<br>effects unless the area effect specifies otherwise (such as in<br>the case of AUGMENT).<br>• Area effects do not affect squares that the user cannot draw<br>line of sight to unless the area effect specifies otherwise.<br>• Some area effects cover a different area if the model using<br>them is on a large base. When this is the case, use the example<br>diagram as a guide.<br>• If a model is affected by two area effects simultaneously the<br>effects are cumaltive as long as the abilities are different --<br>even if their effects are the same.<br>• Some area effects replace the distance portion of a model’s<br>special ability ie Magic X, Missile X, or Range X. In this case<br>ignore the ‘X’ portion of the ability that allows them to target<br>distant models and replace it with the area effect.
